# Cup Shuffle Game Prototype

## Overview
This is a prototype for a 3D Cup Shuffle game developed in Unity. The player needs to guess under which cup the coin is hidden after shuffling. This project was created to participate in the **[Oficina Jam - Mai 2024](https://itch.io/jam/oficina-jam-mai-2024)**, with the theme "Coins". This prototype is not finalized.

## Features
- **Cup Shuffling:** Cups shuffle in a parabolic motion.
- **Player Interaction:** Players can select a cup to reveal and check if their guess is correct (an object to be found inside the cup was not implemented).
- **Outline Effect:** Highlights the cups when hovered over for better visual feedback.

## Assets Used
- **[Red Cup by plaggy](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/food/beverage/cc0-red-cup):** A free 3D model of a red cup.
